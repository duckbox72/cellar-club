## Distinctiveness and Complexity

CellarClub was conceived to be a mix of a bottle-collection manager and a cellar manager with the ability to keep track of the physical location of items, helping users to find them easily when they need. Among other features, it also offers users the ability to write tasting reviews for own future reference and publicise them to the CellarClub community where other users can also read and reference. 

The application utilizes Django on the back-end including 7 models and 35 routes that handle authentication, provided database's search engine, general search engine, external service api calls, users and collections related data management, database imports and data to be rendered requests. Also on the back, it uses a SQLite3 database  order to keep it simple and lighweight.

On the front-end CellarClub utilizes JavaScript libary React to improve application page routing and rendering response time among it's 12 different available pages/views/routes and it's 18 complementary components. In addition to that, aiming best UI experience and having design, styling and mobile-responsiveness performances in mindi, it also makes use of Material-UI framework.
