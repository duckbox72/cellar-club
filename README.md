## Distinctiveness and Complexity

CellarClub was conceived to be a mix of a bottle-collection manager and a cellar manager with the ability to keep track of the physical location of items, helping users to find them easily when they need. Among other features, it also offers users the ability to write tasting reviews for own future reference and publicise them to the CellarClub community where other users can also read and reference. 

The application utilizes Django on the back-end including 7 models and 35 routes that handle authentication, provided database's search engine, general search engine, external service api calls, users and collections related data management, database imports and data to be rendered requests.

On the front-end CellarClub utilizes JavaScript libary React to improve user-side routing and rendering response time among it's 12 different available pages/views/routes and it's 18 complementary components. For best UI experience, minding design, styling and mobile-responsiveness performances it makes use of Material-UI framework.
