## Intro [0:00]
Hello, my name is Luis Klaus and this is Capstone for CS-50W

For this implementation, i introduce you to CellarClub! A complete wine-cellar-manager web-applicatioon made with Python and Javascript where users are able to easily create and mantain a collection from a more than 100.000 items native database.

## Unauthenticated views/pages [0:20]
Un-authenticaded users are directed to a Landing page where they can follow links to REGISTER or SIGN IN. In our case, we are going to SIGN IN to A user i have prevously created for this demonstration.

## Home/Search page, UI features  [0:33]
After authentication we are taken to the Home page from where we can perform searches and add items or reviews to the collection, check inventory statistics and follow links to the other views.

CellarClub has a completely responsive UI - added to improve the experience among multiple devices - including web and mobile. A Darkmode-theme-selector is also available to make usage more confortable in dark enviroments.

## Searchbar and Add item or Review [1:05]
The SEARCHBAR is present throughout the app. Here in Home Page it's role is to search for wines to be added to the collection or to be reviewed.

So, let's seach for Caymus which is a top tier Napa Valley Cabernet, let's select it and now we can write a tasting review for this item, or add it to our collection,

To do that we can enter some specific information ON the bottle like vintage, size, quantity, unit cost, location including cellar or fridge and bin, store, date and a personal note - and to confirm we press the submit button. 

## Collection page [1:50]
Next, we are taken to the COLLECTION page, where we can see by default, the most recently added items including the one we have just added, click the SORT-BY menu to change the listing order, OR use the searchbar to locate specific items.

Additionally every item is clickable so we can open it's profile just by clicking on it.

## Bottle page [2:13]
In this page we have access to the bottle complete profile including all provided metadata plus the information we entered ourselfs. Other than that we also have the ability to FAVORITE, drink or remove the bottle.

So, Let's open the drink Bottle view. Here we can provide a PRIVATE NOTE, drinking date and register if any money was gathered. We also have the option to add a review for the item.For that we set the privacy status, select a like/dislike feedback, set a score and write a tasting note.


## Memories page [2:58]
This time when submit is pressed, the cosumption is added and we are taken to de Memories Page. 
By default MEMORIES are also shown from the most recent. For each item we can quickly reference the REASON of removal THE-DATE the bottle was consumed, AND these icons represent wheter the item has A-PRIVATE-NOTE, has gathered any money or has a review.      

## Memory page [3:22]
Clicking on the item will access the Memory page. Where we can see the complete profile, and have the hability to UNCONSUME the bottle returning it to collectio AND access it's review if there is one.
